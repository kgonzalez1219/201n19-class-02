  <h1>About Me: Katherine Gonzalez</h1>

  <p>My name is Katherine Gonzalez, I was born in Lewiston, Maine 28 years ago in the middle of a snow storm. From then on my family moved from place to place. Stopping here and there, but never for long. Upon graduating High School I joined the Navy and continued to move around, this time going whereever Uncle Sam told me. I eventually settled in Washington state where I met my husband  and put down roots. We now live happily with our three children, two dogs, three chickens, one cat and a fish.</p>

  <h2>Education History</h2>

  <p>I started college but.....never finished. I originally wanted to write and illustrate graphic novels, but now only pursue it as a hobby.</p>

  <h2>Job Experience</h2>

  <p>My job experience is pretty limited, yet varied at the same time. I  spent most of my adult life in the military, but the within that time I did several smaller jobs. I've done everything from moving aircraft and fighting fires on an aircraft carrier to facillitating religious ceremonies in a base chapel. </p>

  <h2>Goals For the Future</h2>

  <p>Since I've settled down y main goals include finding a place for myself where I can flourish and grow and  be with my family.</p>
