  <h1>About Me: Katherine Gonzalez</h1>

  <p>My name is Katherine Gonzalez, I was born in Lewiston, Maine 28 years ago in the middle of a snow storm. From then on my family moved from place to place. Stopping here and there, but never for long. Upon graduating High School I joined the Navy and continued to move around, this time going whereever Uncle Sam told me. I eventually settled in Washington state where I met my husband  and put down roots. We now live happily with our three children, two dogs, three chickens, one cat and a fish.</p>
